# Bizleaker - Bizum Name Scraper

Bizleaker records name (usually name and the initials of the surnames) information from the Bizum service automatically. The purpose of the tool is to check large amounts of telephone numbers quickly without graphical interface, to prevent scam, harassment, identity theft or to simply identify a friend before adding him as a contact.

Plenty of companies receive tons of petititons and messages through SMS, chat applications or phone calls through numbers they usually blindly trust because of the large volume of contacts they must attend to and the urgency of their tasks. In many cases, this ends up with many problems, messages that were intented to a different contact, confussions, information leaks, administrative errors or the worst of all (although not uncommon) money scams.

Bizleaker helps companies and individuals to check the identity of these numbers in a quick and easy way to prevent these types of problems. Bizleaker does not access in any illegal way to this information or to any service.
